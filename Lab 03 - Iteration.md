# **Lab 03 \- Loops**

You will make a copy of this document for your work. Submit your work to the Lab 03 Assignment in D2L. Solutions will be posted the day after the lab is due and only for students who submit work. Check your answers \- learning to self-assess is super important and will help you become a better computer scientist\!

**Please answer these questions on your own. You may not get answers from chegg.com or Course Hero or any other such websites, or from other students.**

1. Write *assignment statements* (one statement using the \= operator) in Python that perform the following operations:

1. Add **num** to **sum** and store the result to **sum**.   
    

|  |
| :---- |

2. Multiply **num** by 2 and store in **result**.  
    

|  |
| :---- |

3. Double the value stored in **userNum**. Do not use any other variables.  
   

|  |
| :---- |

*For questions 2 \- 5, create a hand tracing table for each of the variables and state what the code will display. Include a copy of your hand tracing table (take a picture if you complete on paper) and include in your answer document:*  
***Hint: Watch the Hand Trace Video in Unit 5 \- lesson 2***

2. 

| `x = 0 y = 5 z = 4  x = y - z - 2 z = z * 2 y = x * -1  print("x =", x, "y =", y, "z =", z) `  | x | y | z |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| **Output:**   |  |  |  |

3. 

| `sum = 2 count = 20 while count > 0:    sum = sum + count    count = count - 5print("sum =", sum, "count =", count)` | sum | count |
| :---- | :---: | :---: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| **Output:**  |  |  |

4.     	

| `for index in range(0, 5):    print(index)` | index |
| :---- | :---: |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
| **Output:** |  |
|  |  |

5.   
   **`for count in range(10, 0, -2):`**  
       **`print(count * 2)`**

|  | count |
| :---- | :---: |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
| **Output:** |  |
|  |  |

6. Write the pseudocode syntax (just the steps you need to perform) that will declare 2 floats for the radius and height of a cylinder and output the volume of the cylinder.   
   Volume of a cylinder \= Ï€r2h \- use PI as 3.14159, r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.  
     
   Here is an example Sample run (user input is in **blue**):

   Enter radius of cylinder: **5.2**

   Enter height of cylinder: **8.1**

   

   The volume is 688.1 cubic inches

7. Write a working Python Program for Question \#6. Take a screenshot of your code and output and paste into your answer document below.

8. Design a program that asks the user for a positive integer, and prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10 for that number, for example if the user enters 3, the output will be:

   1 \* 3 \= 3

   2 \* 3 \= 6

   3 \* 3 \= 9

   4 \* 3 \= 12

   5 \* 3 \= 15

   6 \* 3 \= 18

   7 \* 3 \= 21

   8 \* 3 \= 24

   9 \* 3 \= 27

   10 \* 3 \= 30

   

You must use a **for in range loop** for this program. Start by *designing a sample run* of your program \- what will it look like when the user runs your program. Make sure to include a description of what the program will do. Do this first before you start thinking about your logic\!

| Sample Run: |

9. Plan out the logic using pseudocode for the program in \#8. Write your pseudocode below.

| Pseudocode: |

10. Write a working Python program for Question \#9. Take a screenshot of your code and output and past into your answer document below.
